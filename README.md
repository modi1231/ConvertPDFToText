Converts a PDF to Text

A quick C# 4.0 app that uses PDFBox.NET-1.7.0 to take a basic pdf and make it plain text.

The app allows this to happe via a local PDF or you can input a PDF web address.

Future updates may include an option to grab all the PDFs off a given page.

This does not format them for a data base insert.. but the plain text can be massaged pretty easy for DB store to search and look up.
